             versioning in software systems
               phenomenon in versioning
             problem urgent in low-level software development.
               low-level: other software relying on it to func consistently
             as it usually goes, devs of the reliable software do understand their product is going
               to be so since its very design stage.
               concieve it to have a stable API
             drives me to the second point of the talk

          <aside class="notes">
            stable consistent API is sometimes not enough
             a strict sense of it should not only be the API which is to conform
               to the previous version behaviour but also the every single piece of information
               on the underlying software accessible to a user.
               to say nothing about responding to interactions undocumented or even prohibited in the API contract.
             consider an example of a notorious city simulator game under the name of SimCity. on market since MS-DOS times
               turned out not to work with Win95. used memory after freeing it. MS spent resources to introduce a
               specially designed mode of memory management.
             turning to my next point i'll try to clarify why such policy is the way to go in the OS development.

             imagine what would have happened if they had refused to support the game in the new windows.
             considering the game was having its rise in popularity, it would have cost them a solid amount of their customers
             who will buy win95 just to discover their game is not supported there. refund.
             it's the whole approach of microsoft versioning. 
             what's more, lots of companies can't do without a program or two which are quite outdated.
             managers will not update if they are told that it's not working on the new version.
